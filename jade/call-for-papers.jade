        p We are looking for anything that you think might be interesting for a wider audience and that is Scala related. Maybe you are using Scala in a novel way? Or you wrote an interesting open-source library? Have an experience report from a project you are working on? Or maybe you just want to show what can be done with the Scala language and existing Scala tools.
