        p We are looking for anything that you think might be interesting for a wider audience and that is Scala related. Maybe you are using Scala in a novel way? Or you wrote an interesting open-source library? Have an experience report from a project you are working on? Or maybe you just want to show what can be done with the Scala language and existing Scala tools.

        p Do you want to see your favourite Scala speaker at Scalar 2016? Let us know who he/she is&mdash;send us his/her name and we will invite them. Or maybe you know somebody personally who deserves to take a stage during Scalar 2016&mdash;connect us with him and we will recruite him! This year's aim for us is to make a custom-fitted conference for our audience.
