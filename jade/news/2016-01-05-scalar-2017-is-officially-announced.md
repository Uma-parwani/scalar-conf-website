The world looks mighty good to me, cause Tootsie Rolls are all I see. Whatever it is I think I see, becomes a Tootsie Roll to me! Tootsie Roll how I love your chocolatey chew, Tootsie Roll I think I'm in love with you. Whatever it is I think I see, becomes a Tootsie Roll to me!

In an age when nature and magic rule the world, there is an extraordinary legend: the story of a warrior who communicates with animals, who fights sorcery and the unnatural. His name is Dar, last of his tribe. He is also called Beastmaster.
