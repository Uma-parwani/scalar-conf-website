      "Being in a Scala community, you've probably heard about type classes. Very basic concept that both commonly used among many Scala libraries and at the same time very fundamental to understand any theoretical concepts behind Functional Programming. This short talk is all about explaining what Type classes are, how to use them and how to create them, with strong emphasis on answering the question 'why should I even care?'. We will focus on both on prons and cons, however speaker will probably be a bit biased towards the former.",

      "We will follow story of couple of developers, struggling with conceptual design problem. As many before them, they will eventually reinvent the wheel. The solution they will end up with, is what we call a Type class.",

      "1. understand any shapeless/scalaz/cats presentation out there (this presentation will give you ability to survive first 10 minutes of mentioned talks)",
      "2. be enlightened that 'monads are just type classes with some laws' (this is not a monad tutorial though)",
      "3. get the 'aha!' moment, realising that they've been using Type classes from time to time, without knowing it"
