speaker_bio: Jan is a Scala & Java developer at GFT Poland. He is very interested in how software works on low detail level and does not find big frameworks appealing. This is the main reason why he loves Scala, a very expressive language that allows one to build the right abstraction quickly without loosing the control on details.

talk_title: Cool toolz in the Scalaz and Cats toolboxes



In this talk we intend to show that the two libraries: Scalaz and Cats widely held to be cryptic, hermetic and full of scary Mooonads in reality contain lots of easy to use components ready to be embeded in your code to make it shorter, clearer and easier to maintain. We will look at certain constructs from pragmatic point of view as just "Design Patterns" that happen to match ideally functional programming style.
