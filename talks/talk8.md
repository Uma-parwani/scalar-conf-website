talk_title: IOT, timeseries and prediction with Android, Cassandra and Spark



IOT has a massive potential and its impact in our daily life is important. Here is an exemple of using a connected object and analysing its data: we'll see how to collect data using the accelerometer sensor of your smartphone. Then, we'll store it in Cassandra as a Timeseries model. Finally, we'll analyse those data and predict the activity with Spark. We will see a live demo on stage to show this solution working in realtime.
