speaker_bio: Marco Borst and Slava Schmidt are freelance Scala Developers. For Zalando SE they created Play-Swagger, an open source plugin that lets Play developers treat Swagger API specifications as the single source of thruth. This work did fuel their interest in protocol languages, the state of the art in API specifications and the safety that this specifications can provide in real world scenarios. They have experience presenting at multiple conferences and meetups from 2013 on, most notably the Java User Group Taiwan, Innovation Days, ScalaDay, QALab and JavaDay in the Ukraine, JavaDay in Belarus, the Scala User Group in Berlin and the Scala World Unconference in the UK.

talk_title: Contract First, Session Types Later!

What are Session Types? What kind of a safety do they provide? We'll demo how "Session Types" can be unified with real world RESTFul applications, in an almost typesafe way.
