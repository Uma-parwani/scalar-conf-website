talk_title: Swave - a fresh Reactive Streams Implementation



One of the most exciting developments of the last two years has been the advent of "Reactive Streams", a powerful new abstraction for defining and scaling pipelined processing logic in a fully asynchronous, non-blocking and generally *reactive* fashion.

In this talk I'll introduce you to a new, fully-featured Reactive Streams infrastructure toolkit for Scala, called "Swave", which has been built from scratch with a special focus on maximum performance, a simple and powerful API as well as minimal dependencies.

We'll look into the general design approach, feature set and core implementation choices as well as basic benchmark and performance figures.

We'll also contrast with other Reactive Streams implementations and highlight pros and cons from a user's perspective.

So the next time you are reaching for a Reactive Streams toolkit you'll have one more choice to pick from.
