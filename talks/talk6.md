speaker_bio: Life hacker with positive attitude but sometimes he's losing his faith in humanity. Still believes in good (people). Java coder coding in Scala on daily basis but without conviction. Fell in love with CSS and Javascript, especially in CoffeeScript. Apache Struts lead developer but no one knows why. Believing that all code you wrote is already @depreacted!
